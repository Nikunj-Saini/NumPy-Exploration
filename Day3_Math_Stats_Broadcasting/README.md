#  Day 3 â€“ Math, Stats & Broadcasting in NumPy

##  Topics Covered

###  Mathematical Operations
- Element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- `np.add()`, `np.subtract()`, `np.multiply()`, `np.divide()`
- Power and square root operations

### ðŸ“Š Statistical Functions
- Mean, median, standard deviation
- `np.mean()`, `np.median()`, `np.std()`
- Axis-wise computation on 2D arrays
- 
###  Broadcasting
- What is broadcasting in NumPy?
- Scalar with array operations
- Vector + matrix operations using broadcasting rules

---

##  Practice Done

- Performed element-wise operations between two arrays
- Calculated summary statistics across rows and columns
- Understood and applied NumPy's broadcasting rules
- Practiced real-world scenarios using broadcasting (e.g., scaling data)

---

##  Mini Challenges Solved

- Subtract mean from each row using broadcasting
- Add two matrices with different shapes using broadcasting
- Simulated normalization using broadcasting on a 2D dataset

---

 All code examples and practice questions are available in the notebook.
